# Hello, welcome to my profile Iâ€™m JoÃ£o Victor Rodrigues de SouzaðŸ‘‹

Hey there, I'm JoÃ£o Victor but people usually call me Jao. I'm a student at IESB university and also finishing a year and half course at ETC(Escola Tecnica de CeilÃ¢ndia). I'm 19 y.o and I've been coding since 2021 (My first contact with programming was with Portugol lmao, but you got to start somewhere rigthðŸ˜‚?). At the moment I'm focused on learning Web Dev related subjects. I enjoy playing videogames ðŸŽ® my favourite genres are FPS and RPG, ðŸŽ¸guitar noob and I also enjoy physical exercisesðŸ’ª.
